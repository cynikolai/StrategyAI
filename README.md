# StrategyAI
A simple exercise in using AI for strategy.

This program implements two strategy modes for playing tic-tac-toe:
- A slight modification of a nash-equilibrium algorithm that never loses
- A neural network trained to play the game against itself.

Built for personal practice over the course of ~10 hours.
